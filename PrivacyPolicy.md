##Terms of Use

###Privacy and Terms
Welcome to Kidhoo (“Kidhoo,” “us,” “our,” “we”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”, “Agreement”) govern your use of our web site (“Site”) and its contents. You should carefully read these Terms of Use.

BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, OR BY USING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND TO THESE TERMS OF USE, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND OUR COPYRIGHT POLICY. YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE REQUIRED NOTICES AND TO TRANSACT WITH US ELECTRONICALLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THESE TERMS OR STATEMENTS, DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND DO NOT USE THIS SITE.
        
To the extent that these Terms of Use are inconsistent with the Privacy Policy, or Copyright Policy, these Terms shall govern.

####Description of Services

Kidhoo provides various content and services via the website www.kidhoo.co (together with any other website which provides that it is governed by these Terms of Use, the “Site”).

####Registration and Subscription

The content and services on the Site are divided into three categories: (a) content and services which can be accessed without registration; (b) content and services which require a subscription (e.g., the payment of a fee). During subscription, you will be required to provide certain information, including personal information, and for subscriptions, financial information. Our use of that information is subject to the Privacy Policy. All fees paid for subscriptions are non-cancellable and non-refundable.

Our Site is available for use by individual users or by organizations. If you are an individual user, you may purchase subscriptions as provided for below. If you are a member of an organization, and wish to purchase multiple subscriptions or different combinations of subscriptions, please contact Kidhoo at subscriptions@kidhoo.co.

There are two types of subscriptions, a “User” subscription and a “Child Profile” subscription.
*A “User” subscription means the right of a specific named individual to access the Site for the purpose of using the materials to teach one or more students. The named User may access the Site from a classroom, from home, or from any location within the United States, provided such named User’s username and password are only used by the specified named individual and from only one location at any point in time.
*“Child Profile” subscription shall mean the ability to use the Site for a specific named student to monitor such student’s performance.
*The username and password provided in connection with a User or Child Profile subscription may only be used by the named individual to whom it is assigned.

A subscription for a User includes the right to purchase up to two Child Profile subscriptions (i.e., it permits the creation, use, and support of up to two Child profiles). You may only use a User subscription with two Child Profiles. If you require additional Child Profile subscriptions, you must acquire additional User subscriptions. Alternatively, as discussed above, if you are a member of an organization, you may contact Kidhoo at the email address provided above for customized pricing.

All information you provide must be accurate and complete. By purchasing a subscription, you are representing and warranting to Kidhoo that you are an authorized user of any purchasing information, such as credit card information, that you provide to us and that you agree to pay all charges resulting from your subscription.

####Access to Site Functionality

Access to certain portions of this Site requires login and password information. Once you have registered or purchased a subscription, you will have login and password information. This information is for your use only and is non-transferable.

You agree that you will be responsible for maintaining your password as confidential and for any activity that occurs as a result of your enabling or permitting another person or entity to use your password. You agree to immediately notify Kidhoo in the event that (i) your password is lost or stolen, or (ii) you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of any other breach of security related to the Site.

####Age of users

In addition to applications and features on our Site that are designed for organizations, educators, parents and guardians, our Site may also offer certain applications and features for Children under the age of 13. To ensure the privacy of these children accessing and using the applications and features, we adhere to the following additional policies:
*All children may freely access areas of our Site open to non-registered users, for which we neither require nor ask for personally identifying information.
*The portion of our Site that may be used by Children under the age of 13 is open only to registered users who are required to provide registration information. Such information is linked to the “Child Profile” subscription. Any information about the individual child’s performance while completing learning activities will be retained and linked to the “Child Profile” subscription to allow tracking of the child’s progress.
*Children may access the Site only if they are first registered and issued a unique ID and password either (i) by a customer organization that has lawful authority to designate the child as a student-user of our Site, or (ii) with the express, prior consent of the child's parent or guardian.
*Use of these applications and features by anyone younger than 18 is permitted only under the supervision of a designated representative of a customer organization, a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you are a customer organization, a parent or legal guardian agreeing to these Terms of Use for the benefit of a child under 18, be advised that you are fully responsible for the child’s use of this Site, including any applicable financial charges and legal liability that the child may incur.
*At all times, a customer organization or a parent or guardian may request that we remove the child's access to the Site.
*None of the activities on the Site, require or entice children to divulge any personally identifying information.
*If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided or attempted to provide us with personal information in a manner not expressly authorized by these Terms of Use, we will use our best efforts to remove the information permanently from our files.
*If you have any questions about children privacy protection please reach out to us at: Kidhoo, 121 Newark Ave, Suite 542, Jersey City, NJ 07302 info@kidhoo.co

####Non-Commercial Use
This site and its contents are for the personal use of the individual or organization acquiring subscriptions. You may not purchase subscriptions to benefit any other person. For example, you may not resell the services offered on this Site or distribute them to any other persons

#### Additional Terms of Subscription
Subscriptions are subject to recurring billing. Subscribers can choose either month-to-month or annual subscriptions to the Site. In each case, billing for the total amount of the subscription will occur on the first day of subscription with no refunds. Subscribers agree to renew subscriptions automatically and to be billed accordingly as determined by the subscription length with no refunds, until the subscriber modifies or cancels the subscription before the next billing cycle date and Kidhoo is subsequently afforded a reasonable opportunity to modify or cancel the subscription accordingly.
        Any pricing designated as “promotional”, “special”, “limited time only” or other short-term offer will remain in effect for the designated duration only and will be adjusted automatically to regular pricing at the conclusion of the designated time period.
